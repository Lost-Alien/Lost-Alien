### About Me
I am a dedicated student of technology focusing on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. My passion lies in creating cohesive systems that bridge the gap between complex software logic and physical hardware implementation. I spend my time exploring how code can interact with the tangible world to solve real-world problems.
